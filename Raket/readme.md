This folder contains my submissions to activity 1 and 3 in the course '62712 Grundl√¶ggende C programmering' at DTU, which I refer to as 'the rocket assignement'. 

Activity 1 is the image 'Raket flowchart' which depicts the flowchart used as the foundation for the program 'Raket.c'.
Activity 3 is the program 'Raket.c' which defines the state of the thrusters on a rocket, based on the altitude of the rocket. 

When executed, the program compares the state of the thrusters at different altitudes and compares it to pre-defined altitude intervals and thrusters states, to see whether or not the intervals are defined correctly. If they are, it returns the altitude, thrusterstate and a GOOD statement. If not, the statement is BAD.
